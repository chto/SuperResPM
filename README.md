# SuperResPM

**SuperResPM** is a differentiable, FastPM-style cosmological solver implemented with [Diffrax](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax).  
The goal is to make it a cosmology-ready code for field-level inferences.

## ðŸš€ Features

- FastPM-like leapfrog solver using `diffrax`
- Differentiable with reversible adjoint for efficient gradient computation
- Compatible with `jaxpm` forces and `jax_cosmo` cosmology
